# Exploratory Data Analysis and Clustering Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to my "Exploratory Data Analysis and Clustering" project. This assignment marks one of the early milestones in my data science journey, where I embarked on the path of coding and data analysis. Through this project, I not only performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) but also delved into various clustering methods, highlighting my growth as a data scientist.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to extract valuable insights from a dataset with the goal of identifying ideal candidates for clustering. The dataset was originally used to categorize employees based on their likelihood of resigning, making it a challenging yet rewarding exploration.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Visualizations:** I harnessed the power of data visualization to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. Visualizations helped reveal underlying patterns and potential clustering candidates.

- **Clustering Algorithms:** I explored the application of two essential clustering algorithms: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN).

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** To ensure the optimal performance of the clustering models, I employed hyperparameter tuning techniques, including the Silhouette Score and the Elbow Method with Inertia.

- **Model Evaluation:** The effectiveness of the clustering models was assessed using metrics such as the Rand Index, Homogeneity, and Completeness.
